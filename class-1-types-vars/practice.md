# Practice problems for class 1

## For each of the following, determine what the type of the value is
```
# 1
True   

# 2
2.99   

# 3
None   

# 4
3      

# 5
3.     

# 6
0      
```

## What about these combinations?

```
# 7
3. + 1      # float

# 8
25 - 16.   

# 9
-5 - 15    

# 10
32 > 335   

# 11
94.2 == 35 

# 12
4 == 4.    

# 13
34 / 322   

# 14
322 % 34   
```

## Entangling strings and numbers

15. What would `7+8` produce?

16. What about `7.+8`? How is this result different from the one above?

17. What would happen if we tried `7+"8"`?

18. What about `"7"+"8"`?


## Converting Between Types

What is the type (ex: integer, float, string, etc) and value (ex: 0, 3.14, "a", etc) of the result? Or is there an error?

```
# 19
int(7.8) 

# 20
float(6)  

# 21
str(6.0) 

# 22
int("2") 

# 23
float("7.8") 

# 24
int("tomato") 

# 25
int("7.8") 

# 26
float("6")

```

## Operators Practice

```
# 27
5 + 3 - 16   

# 28
25 // 4       

# 29
8+4*2        

# 30
(8+4)*2        

# 31
3 ** 5         

# 32
3.0 ** 5       

# 33
3/2            

# 34
16.3 % 16      

# 35
True or False    

# 36
True and False    

# 37
3 > 4 or 3 == 3   

# 38
not False        

# 39
not (4 > 3 and 100 > 6)    

# 40
4 == 2 + 2        
```

## Concept question

41. What if we make `x = 1` and then executed `x = x+5`? Do you think this is allowed? If so, what would `x` be equal to?
42. What is `new_amount` equal to after executing this piece of code?

```
amount = 3
amount - 5.3
new_amount = amount + 8.8
```

43. Write some code to set `pi` equal to `3.14`, `r` equal to `10`, and `area` equal to `pi` times `r` squared.
